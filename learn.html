        <h2>The Basics <hr></h2>
        <h4>Before we dive into the ins & outs of genetics lets define two basic terms we will need to know:</h4>
        <ul>  
          <li><strong>Cells: </strong><br>
              The basic strucutral component of all living organisms.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Heredity:</strong><br>
              Passing on of genetic material from parent to offspring.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Genes & DNA  <hr> </h2> 
        <p><i>'Our own genomes carry the story of evolution, written in DNA, the language of molecular genetics, and the narrative is unmistakable.'</i> <br>
        - Kenneth R. Miller <br><br>
        DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the hereditary information that is within living organisms that is like a code of instructions that make each orgranism the way it is.
        It is because of DNA you have the hair color you do, the height you have, and everything about you inside, and out.
        <br></br>

        DNA is organized into into individual units called <i>genes</i>, and these contain instructions for the function of every cell, and enzyme in our body.

        <h3>DNA Structure <hr></h3>
        The shape of DNA is usually described as a "double helix".
        DNA is a nucleic acid, and it consists of individual units called nucleotides, which have three components: a molecule of sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogen-containing molecule called a <i>base</i>.
        <br></br>
        To picture this double helix one can think of a ladder in which the two veritcal sides are a sugar molecule, and a phosphate group.
        The rungs of this ladder are the most imporant part are pairs of bases, one coming from each side of the vertical strands.
        <br></br>
        There are four bases these base pairs can be comprised of:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Adenine (A)</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Thymine (T)</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Cytosine (C)</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Guanine (G)</strong></li>
        </ul>

        </div>
        </div>
        <div class="media-object-section">
        <p>From here on we will refer to each base by it's letter (A,T,C,G).
        However, these bases do not pair up randomly. Every time a C protrudes from one side, it forms hydrogen bonds with a G on the other side (and vice versa: a G always bonds to a C). Similarly, every time a T protrudes from one side, it forms hydrogen bonds with an A on the other side (and vice versa). For this reason, each DNA molecule always has the same number of Gs as Cs, and the same number of As as Ts.</p>

        <h3>Genome <hr></h3>
        The full set of DNA present in an individual organism is called its genome. In prokaryotes, including all bacteria, the information is contained within circular pieces of DNA. In eukaryotes, including humans, this information is laid out in long linear strands of DNA in the nucleus. Rather than being one super-long DNA strand, eukaryotic DNA exists as many smaller, more manageable pieces, called chromosomes. Humans, for example, have three billion base pairs, divided into 23 unique pieces of DNA. Because we have two copies of each (one from our mother, one from our father), we have 46 chromosomes.

        Within the long sequences of bases in a cell’s DNA molecules are relatively short sequences, on average about 3,000 bases long, that are the actual genes. The location or position of a gene on a chromosome is called a locus (pl. loci). “Gene” may seem like an impossibly nebulous concept, because the word is often used casually in the media as if it were some magical, irresistible, and mysterious force that controls our bodies and behavior. Beyond these vague descriptions, though, the word has a literal meaning. A gene is a sequence of bases (or, more precisely, base pairs) in a DNA molecule that carries the information necessary for producing a functional product, usually a polypeptide or RNA molecule. Nothing more, nothing less.

        Remember that a DNA molecule is like a ladder in which half of each rung is any one of the four bases—A, T, G, or C. Strung together, a segment might be read as “AAAGGCTAGGC…” continuing on for another 3,000 or so bases. Returning to our cookbook analogy, just as a particular sequence of letters in a cookbook may be read and understood as the directions for baking chocolate chip cookies, the sequence of bases in DNA also carries information. Perhaps the sequence spells out part of the instructions for producing a red blood cell, or for constructing the keratin that will form part of a curly strand of hair, or for assembling a chemical that alters your brain chemistry so that you exhibit a mood disorder or suicidal behavior.

        Each gene is the instruction set for producing one particular molecule, usually a protein. For example, there is a gene in silk moths that codes for fibroin, the chief component of silk. And, there is a gene in humans that codes for triglyceride lipase, an enzyme that breaks down dietary fat.
